  > After working with OSRM, we soon realized that routing with open source data could be made even better by embedding road characteristics and connectivity information in tiles, along with providing dynamic, run-time costing for custom transportation modes. In under six months, the Valhalla development team came on board and created a open source, world-class routing and navigation tool using OpenStreetMap road network data.

## pgRouting

* [Identification of Optimum Shortest Path using Multipath Dijkstra’s Algorithm Approach](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/df7b/9ac6283bccf781a2360e095e53a9efbd75f3.pdf)

	>  But in our application, it is not only the shortest path distance in general geographic sense but it also provides cost parameter dynamically including time and the capacity of the line. We propose a road-routing web based geographic information system which helps to find the shortest path between source and destination in order to optimize it by implementing new technologies through which cost parameters are calculated dynamically with the help of PgRouting.

## GraphHopper

  > Now if there are traffic information in an another table, another View can be created that links the traffic information table with the road network table via SQL that gives the maxspeed a higher value for roads that have less traffic and lower values that have more traffic. This will give priority to roads with less traffic when doing path searches.

 > Mobility is the catchy term for Smart City projects and location intelligence. Think of it as a service that gives you an estimated travel time in the city that you live based on the origin and destination pair of your travel and time of the day. The time of day can even cover seasonality since you wouldn’t expect the same travel times in the thick summer afternoon heat and the grey winter morning fog. Moreover, the selection of a precise date can yield endless searches: morning peaks just on weekends in May, since you are traveling to Barcelona at that time of the year, or summer middays around 15:20 pm on Fridays, since you have a summer internship in London. Uber Movement data is just the beginning.
